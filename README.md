# Storefront
Shopify Storefront demo

## The Project
A Shopify Storefront build using the Shopify Buy SDK.

## The Setup
1. Create a Shopify development store
2. Create a Private app inside the development store
3. Get familiar with the Shopify Buy SDK docs
4. Clone this repo, plugin your own Access Token and Store name
5. Have fun!

## Things I wish I knew
* Your access token is visible in the Shopify Private app settings page.
* For store domain– you don't enter the entire url. If your store is called 'shrimps-bbq'. Then your url is 'shrimps-bbq.myshopify.com'.
* Importing the Shopify SDK via @import can be a bit iffy. I suggest using the CDN to load it in (as I did in my project).
* Don't use examples of older versions! (there's a lot of great examples on codepen– they use .7 versions of the sdk, which is not usable for the latest sdk version.
